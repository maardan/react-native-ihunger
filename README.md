· What the project does

  Demonstrates the basic functionality of Yelp.

· How much time you spent (feel free to call out parts that took more time if any)

  I spent 3 hours, Google Map integration and styling took most time.

· Given additional time, say a whole week, where would you like to have gone with this exercise

  I would:
    -Make the app more sophisticated yet keeping it simple at the time.  
    -Eject the app
    -Implement Redux
    -Implement backend to keep API keys secure
    -Make the Google Maps a modal popup. 
    -Keep separately file for networking
    -Definitely work more on the cosmetics/styles

· Any other questions and thoughts you may have that you would like to discuss

  This app was only tested on an Android device.  Any other thoughts, I would love to discuss on-site.

· To run the project:

  1) Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone (keep in mind this app was only tested on an Android device)
  2) $ npm install
  3) $ npm start (don't forget to turn on your location)
